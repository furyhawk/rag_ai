The Practical Driving Test (PDT) is the final and most important step on your journey to obtaining a full driving licence in Singapore.

Once you’ve successfully completed your Final Theory Test (FTT), you can proceed to book your PDT, where you will be tested on your ability to operate a vehicle both within a driving centre’s circuit and on public roads.

This test not only evaluates how well you can handle basic driving manoeuvres but also how safely and confidently you can drive in real-world environments.

Where To Take The PDT?

Passing the PDT is mandatory for those pursuing a Class 3 (manual) or Class 3A (automatic) licence. It’s administered at one of three driving centres: Bukit Batok Driving Centre (BBDC), ComfortDelGro Driving Centre (CDC), or Singapore Safety Driving Centre (SSDC).

Structure of the Practical Driving Test

Here’s a breakdown of the structure of the PDT:

1. Circuit Test

The first part of the PDT takes place in the driving centre’s circuit, which is a controlled environment that simulates specific driving scenarios. You will be tested on a variety of key skills:





Parallel Parking: The ability to park your car between two stationary vehicles within a designated space.



Reverse Parking: Reversing your car into a parking lot smoothly and without hitting any surrounding barriers or obstacles.



Slope Test: Your ability to stop and start the vehicle on an incline without rolling backward.



S-Course and Crank Course: These sections of the test assess your steering control and your ability to navigate tight bends and sharp angles.



Emergency Braking: Execute a sudden stop in response to a simulated emergency to demonstrate your reflexes and control of the vehicle​.

2. Road Test

The second part of the PDT takes place on public roads. This portion evaluates how well you handle actual driving conditions, interact with other road users, and respond to traffic signals:





Lane Discipline: Maintaining proper lane positioning, executing safe lane changes, and adhering to road markings.



Speed Management: Driving within the speed limit and adjusting your speed based on road conditions, traffic flow, and hazards.



Blind Spot Checks: Demonstrating awareness by checking your blind spots when turning or changing lanes.



Signalling: Correct and timely use of indicators when making turns, changing lanes, or stopping.



Pedestrian and Traffic Awareness: Giving way to pedestrians at crossings and being mindful of surrounding vehicles, cyclists, and other road users.

Key Skills Tested in the Circuit

Here are the key skills that will be tested during the Circuit phase:



 1. Parallel Parking





What’s Tested: Your ability to park the vehicle in a tight spot between two stationary objects (usually represented by poles or barriers) without hitting them.



What to Watch Out For: Ensure that you park within the designated lines and avoid hitting the kerb or poles. Correct use of the mirrors, indicators, and steering control is essential to avoid accumulating demerit points.



Common Mistakes: Failing to adjust the vehicle within the space, mounting the kerb, or hitting the poles/barriers can result in immediate failure.

2. Reverse Parking





What’s Tested: You will need to reverse into a parking lot smoothly, demonstrating control and awareness of your vehicle's surroundings.



What to Watch Out For: Ensure that the vehicle is well-aligned within the lot and that you use mirrors to check for obstacles. Proper use of the steering wheel during reversing is crucial.



Common Mistakes: Incorrect alignment in the lot or reversing too far back beyond the lot boundary will lead to point deductions or possible failure.

3. Slope Test





What’s Tested: The slope test evaluates your ability to stop and start the vehicle on an incline without rolling backward.



What to Watch Out For: Use the handbrake to prevent rollback and smoothly accelerate to move forward. Failure to engage the handbrake properly or rolling back too far may result in immediate failure.



Common Mistakes: Failing to control the vehicle on the slope, rolling back excessively, or stalling the engine.

4. S-Course and Crank Course





What’s Tested: These courses are designed to assess your steering control and ability to navigate tight bends and narrow paths.



What to Watch Out For: Maintain slow, steady control of the vehicle while making sharp turns. Proper use of mirrors and careful steering is essential to avoid hitting the kerbs or barriers.



Common Mistakes: Driving too fast through the course, hitting the kerb, or failing to adjust steering during turns​.

5. Emergency Braking





What’s Tested: Simulation a sudden stop situation where you need to bring the car to a halt quickly and safely.



What to Watch Out For: React promptly to the examiner's signal to brake. Ensure that you press the brake firmly and that the car comes to a controlled stop.



Common Mistakes: Failing to brake fast enough, stopping abruptly without control, or not applying enough force on the brakes.

6. Directional Change





What’s Tested: Make a three-point turn in a confined space, testing your ability to change directions in a limited area.



What to Watch Out For: Use mirrors and indicators before making each turn. Make sure your vehicle stays within the designated area and that you don’t hit the kerb or surrounding objects.



Common Mistakes: Misjudging the available space, hitting obstacles, or taking too long to complete the manoeuvre​.

Key Skills Tested on Public Roads

Here are the key skills that are tested during the public road segment of the PDT:

1. Lane Discipline





What’s Tested: Maintaining proper lane positioning and lane discipline throughout the test. This includes sticking to your lane, making smooth lane changes when necessary, and staying centred within the lane.



What to Watch Out For: Ensure that you stay in the correct lane, especially when turning or merging. Use your mirrors and blind spot checks before making any lane changes. Stay within the speed limit and avoid swerving between lanes.



Common Mistakes: Drifting out of the lane, failing to use signals, or making abrupt lane changes without checking blind spots.

2. Speed Management





What’s Tested: The ability to drive at appropriate speeds based on road conditions, speed limits, and traffic flow.



What to Watch Out For: Stay within the speed limits at all times. Adjust your speed based on traffic, weather conditions, and road signs. When driving through areas like school zones or residential areas, reduce your speed accordingly.



Common Mistakes: Driving too fast or too slow for the given road conditions, or failing to adjust speed in response to hazards or road signs​.

3. Blind Spot Checks





What’s Tested: Your ability to check blind spots before making any turns, lane changes, or moving off from a stop. Proper observation of your surroundings is critical to avoid accidents.



What to Watch Out For: Always check your mirrors and blind spots before changing lanes, turning, or moving off from a stationary position. Exaggerate your head movements so that the examiner can see that you are actively checking your blind spots.



Common Mistakes: Failing to check blind spots before making a manoeuvre, which can lead to immediate failure. Ensure that you don’t rely solely on mirrors and that you physically turn your head to check for vehicles or cyclists in your blind spot​.

4. Signalling





What’s Tested: Proper and timely use of indicators when turning, changing lanes, or stopping. This demonstrates your awareness of other road users and ensures that they know your intentions.



What to Watch Out For: Use your indicators well in advance of making any turns or lane changes. Signal early enough for other drivers to react appropriately, but avoid signaling too soon, which can confuse others about your intentions.



Common Mistakes: Failing to signal, signaling too late, or forgetting to cancel the indicator after completing a manoeuvre. Ensure your indicators are off when driving straight to avoid confusion.

5. Pedestrian and Traffic Awareness





What’s Tested: Your ability to anticipate the actions of pedestrians, cyclists, and other road users. You need to be aware of your surroundings and make adjustments to your driving.



What to Watch Out For: Slow down when approaching pedestrian crossings or busy intersections. Give way to pedestrians at crosswalks and always be ready to stop for pedestrians or cyclists who may enter the road unexpectedly.



Common Mistakes: Failing to yield to pedestrians, not noticing cyclists or motorcyclists, and not reacting in time to changes in traffic conditions. Always remain vigilant and ready to adjust your driving as needed​.

6. Road Junctions and Roundabouts





What’s Tested: Navigating intersections, junctions, and occasional roundabouts safely and efficiently. This includes proper use of lanes, giving way to oncoming traffic, and making clear decisions.



What to Watch Out For: At junctions, ensure that you follow the right-of-way rules. If roundabouts feature, approach at a safe speed and observe traffic already in place.



Common Mistakes: Not giving way to vehicles who have right of way, failing to stay in the correct lane, or signaling incorrectly can result in demerit points or even immediate failure​.

Demerit Points System and Immediate Failures

The demerit points system is designed to measure the severity of mistakes made during the test. The goal is to stay under the threshold of 20 points. Points are categorised as follows:

Minor Mistakes - 2–4 points per error





Failing to check mirrors before making a turn.



Slightly rolling backward during the slope test.



Minor speed violations (driving too slowly or slightly over the speed limit).



Incomplete signaling or signalling too late before lane changes​.

Moderate Mistakes: 6–8 points per error





Incorrect lane discipline (drifting out of your lane).



Improper handling of parking maneuvers (parallel parking or reverse parking errors).



Failing to give way at junctions.

Severe Mistakes: 9-12 points per error (danger to safety)





Driving at an unsafe speed



Improper handling of junctions

Immediate Failure Conditions

Certain actions or mistakes are classified as "immediate failures" because they pose a significant risk to road safety:





Mounting the Kerb: Hitting or driving onto the kerb while parking or making turns.



Failing to Stop at Stop Lines: Failing to come to a complete stop at stop lines, particularly at junctions or pedestrian crossings​.



Rolling Back Excessively on a Slope: Slight rollback may lead to demerit points, significant rollback (typically over one metre) during the slope test can cause immediate failure.



Failing to Give Way: Not yielding to pedestrians or other road users when required, especially at pedestrian crossings, junctions, or roundabouts.



Reckless Driving: Any act of driving that endangers others, such as speeding significantly over the limit or unsafe overtaking.



Dangerous Vehicle Control: Improper control of the vehicle, such as stalling multiple times in traffic or making abrupt stops that could cause accidents​.

What to Expect on Test Day

Being well-prepared not only in terms of driving skills but also knowing what to expect on test day can greatly reduce anxiety and improve your chances of passing... here’s what will happen on the day:

1. Arriving at the Test Centre





Arrival Time: Ensure that you arrive at least 15 to 30 minutes before your scheduled test time. This gives you ample time to check in, prepare mentally, and go over any last-minute details.



Check-in Process: You’ll need to present your NRIC or FIN card for identity verification. Ensure you have your test appointment slip (physical or digital) ready as well.



Waiting Room: After checking in, you will be asked to wait in a designated area. It’s important to remain calm and use this time to focus on the key skills you'll be demonstrating during the test​.

2. Vehicle Preparation





Pre-test Inspection: Before starting the test, make sure you check that the car’s mirrors are properly adjusted, seatbelt is fastened, and that you are familiar with all the vehicle controls.



Test Vehicle: If you're using your own vehicle (in the case of private learners), ensure it's roadworthy and compliant with the test requirements.

3. Meeting Your Examiner





Introductions: Once your examiner calls your name, greet them politely. A respectful and positive attitude can help set the right tone for the test.



Instructions: Listen carefully to the examiner’s instructions and feel free to ask for clarification if anything is unclear. Throughout the test, they will give directions such as “turn left at the next junction” or “make a U-turn ahead” and they expect you to respond promptly and safely.

4. During the Test





Circuit Portion: The test will start with the circuit segment (as described in earlier sections). Follow the examiner’s instructions carefully and remain calm while performing the various tasks.



Public Road Test: After the circuit, you’ll proceed to the road test portion, where your ability to navigate real-world traffic conditions will be assessed.

What Happens After the Test?

You will receive immediate feedback on whether you’ve passed or failed. Regardless of the outcome, it’s important to understand the next steps to take:

If You Pass the Test





Apply for Your Driving Licence: You can immediately apply for your Singapore driving licence. You will typically do this through the Traffic Police e-Services portal, where you can submit your application online.



Temporary Licence: In most cases, you’ll receive a temporary driving licence while your full licence is being processed. This temporary licence allows you to start driving immediately.



Collecting Your Full Licence: Your official driving licence card will be mailed to you within a few weeks of passing the test.

If You Fail the Test





Booking a Retest: You’ll need to wait before booking a retest. The waiting period is usually one month, allowing you time to improve your skills and retake the test.



Revision Lessons: Most driving schools will require you to attend revision lessons before attempting the test again. These lessons are an opportunity to focus on areas highlighted by your examiner.

Managing Your Emotions After the Test

Dealing with Disappointment

Failing the test can be frustrating, but it’s important not to let it discourage you. Many learners don’t pass on their first try. Focus on the areas where you need improvement, and use your next attempt as an opportunity to demonstrate growth.

Celebrating Success

If you pass, take the time to celebrate this major achievement. Earning your driving licence is a significant milestone, and you’re now one step closer to enjoying the freedom and responsibility of driving independently​.

Tips for Success

Successfully passing the Practical Driving Test (PDT) requires more than just technical driving skills - it’s about demonstrating confidence, safety, and awareness on the road:

Practise in Different Conditions

Practise driving at different times of the day and in various weather conditions, such as rain or during peak traffic hours as this will help you get accustomed to real-world road conditions.

Review Your Weaknesses

Take note of areas you struggle with during your practice sessions, such as parallel parking, checking blind spots, or managing speed on slopes. Focus on refining these weak points with the help of your instructor.

Practise Regular Safety Checks

Get into the habit of performing safety checks such as checking mirrors, blind spots, and using signals every time you drive. Make these checks obvious by moving your head to show the examiner that you’re being diligent.

Stay Calm and Focused

On test day, focus on staying calm, breathing steadily, and concentrating on the road ahead. Avoid overthinking mistakes if they happen, and focus on the next part of the test.

Over-Prepare for the Circuit Test

Practise the circuit manoeuvres multiple times to ensure you can perform them confidently under pressure.

Know the Test Routes

Familiarise yourself with the BBDC test routes, CDC test routes or SSDC test routes depending on your chosen centre. Practise driving on these routes with your instructor, paying attention to tricky areas like junctions or heavy traffic zones.

Don’t Rush

Take your time with each manoeuvre, especially during parking and turns. It’s better to perform the action slowly and correctly than to rush and make mistakes.

Get a Good Night’s Sleep

Make sure you get enough rest the night before your test. Avoid cramming or practising excessively the day before, as this can lead to exhaustion.

Common Mistakes to Avoid

Here are some of the most common mistakes made during the PDT and tips on how to avoid them:

Incomplete or Inadequate Blind Spot Checks

What Happens: Examiners need to see that you’re fully aware of your surroundings. Failing to check your blind spots properly before moving off, turning, or changing lanes can result in demerit points or immediate failure.

How to Avoid: Make your head movements obvious when checking blind spots. Turn your head fully to the left or right to demonstrate to the examiner that you’ve checked both sides. Exaggerate your mirror checks so they can clearly see your actions​.

Improper Lane Discipline

What Happens: Drifting out of your lane, failing to stay centred, or incorrect lane changes.

How to Avoid: Maintain a steady position within your lane, and use your mirrors and indicators well in advance when switching lanes. Always perform a blind spot check before changing lanes or merging into traffic. Avoid abrupt lane changes by planning your manoeuvres early​.

Failing to Stop Completely at Stop Lines

What Happens: Many learners fail to come to a full stop at stop lines, particularly at junctions and pedestrian crossings, leading to an immediate fail.

How to Avoid: Make sure to stop before the stop line and ensure the vehicle comes to a complete halt. Check for oncoming traffic and pedestrians before moving off again. Use your side mirror to check your distance from the line to ensure you haven’t crossed it​.

Forgetting to Signal / Incorrect Signaling

What Happens: Not signaling before a turn, lane change, or stop can lead to demerit points. Incorrect or late signaling can confuse other drivers and lead to potential hazards.

How to Avoid: Always signal in advance of any turn, lane change, or manoeuvre. Make sure to turn off your signal after the manoeuvre is completed to avoid confusing other road users.

5. Rolling Back on a Slope

What Happens: Rolling back too far when performing the slope test can lead to immediate failure if the rollback is significant. Even slight rolling backward can result in demerit points.

How to Avoid: When performing the slope test, ensure the handbrake is fully engaged before moving off. Gradually release the handbrake while pressing the accelerator to prevent rollback.

Speeding or Driving Too Slowly

What Happens: Exceeding the speed limit or driving too slowly can result in demerit points or, in extreme cases, immediate failure. Driving too slowly can cause traffic flow issues and be just as hazardous as speeding.

How to Avoid: Stay within the speed limits posted and adjust your speed based on road conditions. On clear roads, maintain the appropriate speed to avoid disrupting traffic. Monitor your speed carefully, especially in school zones or residential areas where speed limits are lower​.

Poor Steering Control

What Happens: Over-steering or under-steering, particularly in tight turns or during manoeuvres like parallel parking, can result in demerit points.

How to Avoid: Practise maintaining smooth control of the steering wheel, especially when navigating tight corners like the S-course or during parking. Make sure your hands stay in the correct position on the steering wheel (usually the 10 and 2 o’clock position) for better control​.

8. Failing to Yield Right of Way

What Happens: Failing to give way to other vehicles, especially at junctions, or pedestrian crossings, can lead to immediate failure.

How to Avoid: Always check for oncoming traffic or pedestrians before proceeding through junctions or crossings. Yield the right of way where appropriate, and do not rush through intersections.
